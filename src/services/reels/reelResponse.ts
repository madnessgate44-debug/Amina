 * Turns a reel answer into what Miss Noor says next.
 *
 * A reel used to end at "correct" or "wrong": the child tapped, saw a fixed
 * line, and the reel moved on. That is a quiz, not a teacher.
 *
 * This service makes the reel respond to the answer the child actually gave:
 *
 *  1. The engine diagnoses first. If the wrong option matches a known
 *     misconception, `matchMisconception` names it and supplies the reframing
 *     from curriculum data. This is deterministic and costs no quota.
 *  2. Only when the answer is wrong AND no misconception is on file does it ask
 *     the model to react to the child's own words. That keeps live calls rare.
 *  3. If the model cannot answer, the curriculum remediation (or the reel's own
 *     line) is used and `degraded` is set, so the card can say the teacher is
 *     offline instead of pretending.
 *
 * A correct answer never costs a call: the reel already has a praise line.
